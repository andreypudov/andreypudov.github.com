It is part of the Zabaykalsky (Trans-Baikal) National Park.

The name "Svyatoy Nos" means "Holy Nose" in Russian. Russian explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries used the word "nose" to mean "cape". "Holy Nose" originally referred to the southwestern cape of the peninsula, and a (now abandoned) village on that cape. Then the name passed on the whole territory of the peninsula.
