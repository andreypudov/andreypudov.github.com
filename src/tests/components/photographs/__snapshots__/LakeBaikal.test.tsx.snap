Pinus pumila, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf pine, dwarf Siberian pine is a tree in the family Pinaceae native to northeastern Asia and the Japanese isles. It shares the common name creeping pine with several other plants.

The Siberian dwarf pine is a coniferous evergreen shrub ranging from 1–3 m in height, exceptionally up to 5 m, but may have individual branches that extend farther along the ground in length. In the mountains of northern Japan, it sometimes hybridises with the related Japanese white pine (Pinus parviflora); these hybrids (Pinus × hakkodensis) are larger than P. pumila, reaching 8–10 m tall on occasion."
