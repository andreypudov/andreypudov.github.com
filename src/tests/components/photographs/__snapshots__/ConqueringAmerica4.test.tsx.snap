Initially, plans included a full-size replica of the famous Eiffel Tower, but due to flight path concerns from McCarran Airport, the tower had to be scaled down. Despite the reduction in its size, the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas still offers the highest viewpoint of the Las Vegas Strip. At its architectural height, it stands over 12 meters taller than the High Roller Ferris wheel at the nearby LINQ.

As part of this project, the Central Park Reservoir was completed in 1862. The reservoir was decommissioned in 1993, after it was deemed obsolete, and control was transferred to the Department of Parks and Recreation in 1999. The Central Park Reservoir was renamed in honor of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1994 to commemorate her contributions to the city and because she enjoyed jogging in the area.
