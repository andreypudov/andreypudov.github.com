The second section, built in 1976, leads to the Mir station at an altitude of 3,470 meters. Its length is 1,800 meters, with a drop of 500 meters. Finally, the last stretch is a chairlift single-seater which then makes it possible to avoid an hour's walk for hikers to the Garabachi huts, at an altitude of 3,847 meters. Built in the late 1970s, it is 1,000 meters long, with a drop of 250 meters."
