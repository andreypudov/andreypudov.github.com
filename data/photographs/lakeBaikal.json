It shares the common name creeping pine with several other plants.\n\nThe Siberian dwarf pine is a coniferous evergreen shrub ranging from 1–3 m in height, exceptionally up to 5 m, but may have individual branches that extend farther along the ground in length. In the mountains of northern Japan, it sometimes hybridises with the related Japanese white pine (Pinus parviflora); these hybrids (Pinus × hakkodensis) are larger than P. pumila, reaching 8–10 m tall on occasion.",

It is part of the Zabaykalsky (Trans-Baikal) National Park.\n\nThe name \"Svyatoy Nos\" means \"Holy Nose\" in Russian. Russian explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries used the word \"nose\" to mean \"cape\". \"Holy Nose\" originally referred to the southwestern cape of the peninsula, and a (now abandoned) village on that cape. Then the name passed on the whole territory of the peninsula. In the Buryat language, the peninsula is called Hilmen Hushun, which means \"sturgeon's muzzle.\"",
