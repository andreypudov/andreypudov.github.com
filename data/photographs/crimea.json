The name is derived from Avestan Harā Bərəzaitī, a legendary mountain in Iranian mythology. Harā Bərəzaitī reflects Proto-Iranian *Harā Bṛzatī, which was reformed into Middle Persian as Harborz, and into Modern Persian as Alborz. Bṛzatī is the feminine form of the adjective *bṛzant (\"high\"), the reconstructed ancestor of Modern Ossetian bærzond (\"high\", \"peak\"), Modern Persian barz (\"high\"), berāzande (\"elegant\"), and boland (\"high\", \"tall\"), and Modern Kurdish barz (\"high\"). Harā may be interpreted as \"watch\" or \"guard\", from Indo-European *ser (\"protect\"). Circassians use the name \"Uash-ha Makhua\" which means \"The mountain of happiness\", The name \"Mingi Taw\" used by Karachays and Balkars means \"Eternal Mountain\" in Turkic languages.",
