      <image:caption>The Kiss of Death  The Kiss of Death is a marble sculpture, found in Poblenou Cemetery. The sculpture is thought to have been created by Jaume Barba, although others have claimed that its idea was conceived by Joan Fontbernat. The sculpture depicts death, in the form of a winged skeleton, planting a kiss on the forehead of a young man. The sculpture elicits varying responses from viewers concerning the depiction of the young man ranging from ecstasy to resignation.  &quot;His young heart is thus extinguished. The blood in his veins grows cold. And all strength has gone. Faith has been extolled by his fall into the arms of death. Amen.&quot;</image:caption>

      <image:caption>St. Peter&apos;s Basilica  The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, or simply Saint Peter&apos;s Basilica, is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City. It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.  Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter&apos;s is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome, St. Peter&apos;s is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as &quot;holding a unique position in the Christian world&quot; and as &quot;the greatest of all churches of Christendom.&quot;</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Dumbo  The area known as Dumbo used to be known as Gairville. The area was originally a ferry landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, Belgian block streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art galleries, and currently a center for technology startups.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Oculus / World Trade Center Station  One of the first decisions that Calatrava had in mind at the time of conceiving the project was the realization of the building at street level, an independent structure along the Wedge of Light Square, by Daniel Libeskind. “Oculus”, the centerpiece of the Transportation Center that presents the new station to the world is a kind of pause in the middle of the dense glass and steel towers that surround it.  The construction, due to constant delays, lasted 12 years and was finally inaugurated on March 3, 2016, without too many celebrations. The cost of its construction, $ 4 billion, greatly exceeded its original cost, becoming, until the time of its inauguration, the most expensive train station in the world and the third largest transportation center in New York, after Grand Central and Penn Station, both in Midtown Manhattan.</image:caption>

It have been founded ca. 1328-1330 by St. Dionysius, who came to Nizhny Novgorod from Kiev Pechersk Lavra with several other monks, and dug for himself a cave on the step Volga shore some 3 km southeast of the city. Later on, he founded at that site a monastery with a church of Resurrection of the Lord.  The monastery soon became an important spiritual and religious center of the Principality of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Central Park  Between 1821 and 1855, New York City&apos;s population nearly quadrupled. As the city expanded northward up Manhattan Island, people were drawn to the few existing open spaces, mainly cemeteries, for passive recreation. These were seen as escapes from the noise and chaotic life in the city, which at the time was almost entirely centered on Lower Manhattan. The Commissioners&apos; Plan of 1811, the outline for Manhattan&apos;s modern street grid, included several smaller open spaces but not Central Park. As such, John Randel Jr. had surveyed the grounds for the construction of intersections within the modern-day park site.  Today, Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most visited tourist attractions worldwide, with 42 million visitors in 2016.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Maidan Nezalezhnosti is the central square of Kyiv. One of the city&apos;s main squares. It has been known under many different names, but often it is called simply Maidan (&quot;square&quot;). In the 19th century, the square contained buildings of the city council and noble assembly. Since the start of Ukraine&apos;s independence movement in 1990, the square has been the traditional place for political rallies, including four large-scale radical protest campaigns: the 1990 student &quot;Revolution on Granite&quot;, the 2001 &quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot;, the 2004 Orange Revolution, and the 2013–14 Euromaidan. Maidan is also a regular site for non-political displays and events, however, since 2014 most of them were moved to Sofiyivska Square or elsewhere, because making entertainment in a place where people were killed during Euromaidan was considered inappropriate. Most notably, Christmas Fairs and New Year celebrations were moved to Sofiyivska Square.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Barcelona&apos;s first airfield, located at El Remolar, began operations in 1916. However, it did not have good expansion prospects, so a new airport at El Prat opened in 1918. The first plane was a Latécoère Salmson 300 which arrived from Toulouse with final destination Casablanca. The airport was used as headquarters of the Aeroclub of Catalonia and the base for the Spanish Navy&apos;s Zeppelin fleet. Scheduled commercial service began in 1927 with an Iberia service to Madrid Cuatro Vientos Airport. This was Iberia&apos;s first route. During the time of the Second Spanish Republic El Prat was one of the bases of LAPE (Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas).</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Peak of Puigmal, is a mountain in the Pyrenees, in the Spanish-French border. Its summit is 2,909.6 metres above sea level, one of the highest peaks in the eastern Pyrenees. Puigmal is near the west end of a fine ridge over 2500m high for 16 km. The west half is composed of friable metasediments (schists) which break down to form smooth slopes, and so give easy walking. The east half is of tougher gneiss and forms spiky alpine scenery with sharp crests and some difficult places. Several excellent circuits can be made from Nuria. The plateau summit of Puigmal is split for several hundred metres by a bold scarp, in places over 20 metres high, with the eastern half having slipped bodily towards Nuria. Several other crests in this range are likewise split.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Kiss of Death  The Kiss of Death is a marble sculpture, found in Poblenou Cemetery. The sculpture is thought to have been created by Jaume Barba, although others have claimed that its idea was conceived by Joan Fontbernat. The sculpture depicts death, in the form of a winged skeleton, planting a kiss on the forehead of a young man. The sculpture elicits varying responses from viewers concerning the depiction of the young man ranging from ecstasy to resignation.  &quot;His young heart is thus extinguished. The blood in his veins grows cold. And all strength has gone. Faith has been extolled by his fall into the arms of death. Amen.&quot;</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The first cemetery at this location was built in 1775, located outside the city&apos;s perimeter wall, as the state of churchyard graves inside the old city was considered unsanitary. After the first cemetery was destroyed by Napoleon&apos;s troops in 1813, the Italian architect Antonio Ginesi was commissioned to rebuild it, and the new site was reconsecrated by Bishop Pau de Sitjar i Ruata on 15 April 1819. It was formally opened in 1898 by the Bishop of Barcelona Josep Climent i Avinent.  The cemetery consists of two large sections: at the front Ginesi created egalitarian terraces of burial niches, while at the rear there is an area of individual monuments and mausolea, crafted for the aesthetic tastes and aspirations of the wealthy bourgeoisie, merchants and manufacturers of the city. A third, narrow section along the South wall mixes niches, monuments and common graves.  The sculpture above the grave of Josep Llaudet Soler is often cited as Poblenou&apos;s best-known monument. Known as The Kiss of Death, the work dates to 1930 and depicts a winged skeleton kissing the cheek of a young man&apos;s apparently lifeless body. The name of the artist Jaume Barba is carved into the base, though some believe the work is the idea of Joan Fontbernat.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Mount Elbrus  The highest and most prominent peak in Russia and Europe. It is situated in the western part of the Caucasus and is the highest peak of the Caucasus Mountains. The dormant volcano rises 5,642m above sea level; it is the highest stratovolcano in Eurasia, as well as the tenth-most prominent peak in the world.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Elbrus has two summits, both of which are dormant volcanic domes. The taller, western summit is 5,642 meters; the eastern summit is 5,621 meters. The eastern summit was first ascended on 10 July 1829 by a Circassian named Khillar Khashirov, and the western summit in 1874 by a British expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner, Horace Walker, and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The name Elbrus seems to have a connection with Alborz (also called Elburz), which is also the name of a long mountain range in northern Iran. The name is derived from Avestan Harā Bərəzaitī, a legendary mountain in Iranian mythology. Harā Bərəzaitī reflects Proto-Iranian *Harā Bṛzatī, which was reformed into Middle Persian as Harborz, and into Modern Persian as Alborz. Bṛzatī is the feminine form of the adjective *bṛzant (&quot;high&quot;), the reconstructed ancestor of Modern Ossetian bærzond (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;peak&quot;), Modern Persian barz (&quot;high&quot;), berāzande (&quot;elegant&quot;), and boland (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;), and Modern Kurdish barz (&quot;high&quot;). Harā may be interpreted as &quot;watch&quot; or &quot;guard&quot;, from Indo-European *ser (&quot;protect&quot;). Circassians use the name &quot;Uash-ha Makhua&quot; which means &quot;The mountain of happiness&quot;, The name &quot;Mingi Taw&quot; used by Karachays and Balkars means &quot;Eternal Mountain&quot; in Turkic languages.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Three ski lifts take visitors up to an altitude of 3,847 meters. Until the mid-2000s, the first section was provided by the Elbrus-1 cable car, construction of which began in 1959. Starting from the Azaou road at 2,180 meters above sea level in the valley, it leads to the old viewpoint (Stari Krougozor) at an altitude of 2,970 meters; at the foot of the terminal tongue of the Mali glacier Azaou, which has retreated since the construction of the facility. Its length is 1,740 meters, with a drop of 650 meters.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Mir station  The second section, built in 1976, leads to the Mir station at an altitude of 3,470 meters. Its length is 1,800 meters, with a drop of 500 meters. Finally, the last stretch is a chairlift single-seater which then makes it possible to avoid an hour&apos;s walk for hikers to the Garabachi huts, at an altitude of 3,847 meters. Built in the late 1970s, it is 1,000 meters long, with a drop of 250 meters.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>There are a wide variety of routes up the mountain, but the normal route, which is free of crevasses, continues more or less straight up the slope from the end of the cable car system, which takes passengers up to 3,800 meters. During the summer, it is not uncommon for 100 people to attempt the summit via this route each day. Winter ascents are rare, and are usually undertaken only by very experienced climbers.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Elbrus is notorious for its brutal winter weather, and summit attempts are few and far between. The climb is not technically difficult, but it is physically arduous because of the altitude and the frequent strong winds. The average annual death toll on Elbrus is 15–30, primarily due to &quot;many unorganized and poorly equipped&quot; attempts to reach the mountain&apos;s summit.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Eiffel Tower  Construction began on the Paris Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino and its accompanying tower in 1997, with its completion taking place the following year. The Paris connects to its sister hotel, Bally’s, via tram. Initially, plans included a full-size replica of the famous Eiffel Tower, but due to flight path concerns from McCarran Airport, the tower had to be scaled down. Despite the reduction in its size, the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas still offers the highest viewpoint of the Las Vegas Strip. At its architectural height, it stands over 12 meters taller than the High Roller Ferris wheel at the nearby LINQ. It’s become a popular place to celebrate Valentine’s Day, host a wedding, and, thanks to the Eiffel Tower Experience, take selfies.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Croton Aqueduct Board president Nicholas Dean proposed the construction of Central Park around its receiving reservoir (later the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond) in the 1850s. As part of this project, the Central Park Reservoir was completed in 1862. The reservoir was decommissioned in 1993, after it was deemed obsolete, and control was transferred to the Department of Parks and Recreation in 1999. The Central Park Reservoir was renamed in honor of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1994 to commemorate her contributions to the city and because she enjoyed jogging in the area.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in America, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution and the nation&apos;s founding, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year.

      <image:caption>Bramante Staircase  The modern double helix staircase, also in the Pio-Clementine Museum, and commonly referred to as the &quot;Bramante Staircase&quot;, was designed by Giuseppe Momo, sculpted by Antonio Maraini and realized by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry in 1932 and was inspired by the original Bramante Staircase. This staircase, like the original, is a double helix, having two staircases allowing people to ascend without meeting people descending; as with the original, the main purpose of this design is to allow uninterrupted traffic in each direction. It encircles the outer wall of a stairwell approximately fifteen meters wide and with a clear space at the centre. The balustrade around the ramp is of ornately worked metal. A canopy located above provides the necessary light to illuminate the stairs. The staircase is located at the end of the museum visit and all visitors leave by this route.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Saint Peter&apos;s Square  Saint Peter&apos;s Square is a large plaza located directly in front of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica in Vatican City. Both the square and the basilica are named after Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus considered by Catholics to be the first Pope.  At the centre of the square is an ancient Egyptian obelisk, erected at the current site in 1586. Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square almost 100 years later, including the massive Doric colonnades, four columns deep, which embrace visitors in &quot;the maternal arms of Mother Church&quot;. A granite fountain constructed by Bernini in 1675 matches another fountain designed by Carlo Maderno in 1613.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Pompeii was an ancient city located in what is now the comune of Pompei near Naples. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was buried under 4 to 6 m of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The eruption lasted for two days. The first phase was of pumice rain lasting about 18 hours, allowing most inhabitants to escape. Only approximately 1,150 bodies have so far been found on site seems to confirm this theory and most escapees probably managed to salvage some of their most valuable belongings; many skeletons were found with jewellery, coins and silverware.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Owing to its wealth and its Greek, Etruscan and Roman history, Pompeii is of great interest for the study of Roman architecture in terms of building methods and urban planning. However, it was a relatively small provincial city and, except for the amphitheatre, it did not have large monuments on the scale of other Roman cities. The smallish size of the town&apos;s architecture is also because it missed the big building schemes of the early Empire and kept much of its urban architecture that dates from as early as the 4th century BC.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Modern archaeologists have excavated garden sites and urban domains to reveal the agricultural staples of Pompeii&apos;s economy. Pompeii was fortunate to have had fertile soil for crop cultivation. The soils surrounding Mount Vesuvius preceding its eruption have been revealed to have had good water-retention capabilities, implying productive agriculture. The Tyrrhenian Sea&apos;s airflow provided hydration to the soil despite the hot, dry climate. Barley, wheat, and millet were all produced along with wine and olive oil, in abundance for export to other regions.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The &quot;Large Palaestra&quot; consists of a large open air square, approximately 140 x 140 m, surrounded by porticoes and enclosed by a high wall with battlements in which there are 10 doors. All that is left of the centuries-old plane trees that were on the three sides of the great courtyard at the time of the eruption are moulds of the roots and there lies a 23 x 35 m pool at the centre. It was built in the Augustan period, at the beginning of the 1st century AD, and was intended for the physical and intellectual training of young citizens. Many erotic or poetic graffiti have been left by visitors on the walls and columns. Numerous victims were found during the excavation who had looked for a refuge or a way to escape through the building in vain.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Evidence of wine imported nationally from Pompeii in its most prosperous years can be found from recovered artefacts such as wine bottles in Rome. For this reason, vineyards were of utmost importance to Pompeii&apos;s economy. Agricultural policymaker Columella suggested that each vineyard in Rome produce a quota of three cullei of wine per jugerum; otherwise, the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient and often capable of largely exceeding these requirements, providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves. While wine was exported for Pompeii&apos;s economy, most other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city&apos;s consumption.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The evolution of Pompeii&apos;s private and public buildings is often unclear because of the lack of excavations beneath the levels of 79. It is, however, clear that by the time of the conquest by Sulla in 89 BC, the development of the street layout was largely complete, and most of the insulae were built up.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Statue of Centaur  Born in 1944, Igor Mitoraj studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, southern Poland, under the legendary artist and theatre director Tadeusz Kantor. He continued his studies in Paris and ultimately settled in Pietrasanta, north western Italy. Besides the French capital, he also held exhibitions in New York, Florence and Lausanne, among others.  Mitoraj&apos;s sculptures typically referenced Antiquity. His art divided critics, with some dismissing his work as kitsch, while others were delighted by his work.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Castel Sant&apos;Elmo  Castel Sant&apos;Elmo is a medieval fortress located on Vomero Hill adjacent to the Certosa di San Martino, overlooking Naples. The name &quot;Sant&apos;Elmo&quot; derives from a former 10th-century church dedicated to Sant&apos;Erasmo, shortened to &quot;Ermo&quot; and, finally altered to &quot;Elmo&quot;. Located near the upper terminus of the Petraio, one of the city&apos;s earliest pedestrian connections between upper and lower Naples, the fortress now serves as a museum, exhibition hall, and offices.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Naples  Founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC, Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. In the eighth century BC, a colony known as Parthenope was established on the Pizzofalcone hill. In the sixth century BC, it was refounded as Neápolis. The city was an important part of Magna Graecia, played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society, and was a significant cultural centre under the Romans.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Vesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of many lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>St. Peter&apos;s Basilica  The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, or simply Saint Peter&apos;s Basilica, is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City. It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.  Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter&apos;s is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome, St. Peter&apos;s is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as &quot;holding a unique position in the Christian world&quot; and as &quot;the greatest of all churches of Christendom.&quot;</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Flavian Amphitheatre  The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Roman Forum  The Roman Forum, also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum, is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.  For centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city&apos;s great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>View of the Arch of Constantine with the Colosseum  The Arch of Constantine is a triumphal arch in Rome dedicated to the emperor Constantine the Great. The arch was commissioned by the Roman Senate to commemorate Constantine&apos;s victory over Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in AD 312. Situated between the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill, the arch spans the Via Triumphalis, the route taken by victorious military leaders when they entered the city in a triumphal procession. Dedicated in 315, it is the largest Roman triumphal arch, with overall dimensions of 21 m high, 25.9 m wide, and 7.4 m deep. It has three bays, the central one being 11.5 m high and 6.5 m wide and the laterals 7.4 m by 3.4 m each. The arch is constructed of brick-faced concrete covered in marble.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Valletta  Valletta&apos;s 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller. The city was named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta. The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture, though the Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the destruction of the Royal Opera House. The city was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980. Today, with 320 monuments, is one of the most dense monuments areas in the world. Sometimes called an &quot;open-air museum&quot;, Valletta was chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2018. Valletta is also the sunniest city in Europe.  The city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers, along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Ħaġar Qim  Ħaġar Qim is a megalithic temple complex found on the Mediterranean island of Malta, dating from the Ġgantija phase (3600–3200 BC). The Megalithic Temples of Malta are among the most ancient religious sites on Earth, described by the World Heritage Sites committee as &quot;unique architectural masterpieces.&quot; In 1992 UNESCO recognized Ħaġar Qim and four other Maltese megalithic structures as World Heritage Sites. V. Gordon Childe, Professor of Prehistoric European Archeology visited Ħaġar Qim. He wrote, &quot;I have been visiting the prehistoric ruins all round the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia to Egypt, Greece and Switzerland, but I have nowhere seen a place as old as this one.&quot;  Ħaġar Qim&apos;s builders used globigerina limestone in the temple&apos;s construction. As a result of this, the temple has suffered from severe weathering and surface flaking over the millennia. In 2009 work was completed on a protective tent.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Sciuta Tower  Sciutu Tower was built in 1637–1638 in Wied iż-Żurrieq, located within the Qrendi boundaries, on the site of a medieval watch post. It served as the prototype for the De Redin towers, which were built between 1658 and 1659.  After the British took over Malta in 1800, Sciutu Tower remained in use and was manned by the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment and later the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. It was abandoned in 1873 but was manned by the Coast Police once again during World War II. The tower subsequently used as a police station until 2002. An original cannon dating back to the Order&apos;s rule can still be found on the tower&apos;s roof.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Senglea  Senglea is a fortified city. It is one of the Three Cities in the Grand Harbour area, the other two being Cospicua and Vittoriosa. The city&apos;s title Città Invicta was given because it managed to resist the Ottoman invasion at the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. The name Senglea comes from the Grand Master who built it Claude de la Sengle and gave the city a part of his name. While Senglea is the 52nd most populated locality on the island, due to its incredibly small land area, it is the 2nd most densely populated locality after Sliema.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Collegiate Church of Saint Lawrence  When the Order of Saint John first settled in Malta in 1530, all of their langues were based in Birgu, so the Church of Saint Lawrence was used as the Order&apos;s first conventual church in Malta. It served this purpose for 41 years from 1530 to 1571 until the Knights were transferred to the new capital city Valletta. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in May 1681 by Bishop Molina. It was completed in 1696. The church was inaugurated by Bishop Davide Cocco Palmieri on the feast of St Lawrence, August 10, 1697. It was consecrated in 1723. In 1820 Pope Pius VII bestowed the dignity of Collegiate church upon the parish church of St Lawrence.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Rotunda of Mosta  The Sanctuary Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady commonly known as the Rotunda of Mosta is a Roman Catholic parish church and Minor Basilica in Mosta, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It was built between 1833 and the 1860s to neoclassical designs of Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, on the site of an earlier Renaissance church which had been built in around 1614 to designs of Tommaso Dingli.  The design of the present church is based on the Pantheon in Rome, has the third largest unsupported dome in the world and is Malta&apos;s largest and most famous church. The church narrowly avoided destruction during World War II when on 9 April 1942 a German aerial bomb pierced the dome and fell into the church during Mass, but failed to explode. This event was interpreted by the Maltese as a miracle.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Mġarr Harbour  The town of Mġarr grew up around the shallow harbour which shares its name. Ferry services to Malta were in operation by 1241, and fishing was already established. Whilst the area around the harbour was developed over the following centuries, there was little development of the harbour itself until 1841, when a breakwater was constructed to provide more shelter to the port. This breakwater was strengthened and extended several times up to 1906. A larger breakwater was constructed between 1929 and 1935, and two more in 1969; on the completion of the latter, the area of the port was expanded to 121,400 square metres.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The city was founded as Maleth in around the 8th century BC by Phoenician settlers, and was later renamed Melite by the Romans. Ancient Melite was larger than present-day Mdina, and it was reduced to its present size during the Byzantine or Arab occupation of Malta. During the latter period, the city adopted its present name, which derives from the Arabic word medina. The city remained the capital of Malta throughout the Middle Ages, until the arrival of the Order of St. John in 1530, when Birgu became the administrative centre of the island. Mdina experienced a period of decline over the following centuries, although it saw a revival in the early 18th century. At this point, it acquired several Baroque features, although it did not lose its medieval character.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Mdina remained the centre of the Maltese nobility and religious authorities (and property continues to largely be passed down from families and from generation to generation), but it never regained its pre-1530 importance, giving rise to the popular nickname the &quot;Silent City&quot; by both locals and visitors. Mdina is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and it is now one of the main tourist attractions in Malta.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>St Paul&apos;s Cathedral  The Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Paul is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Mdina, dedicated to St. Paul the Apostle. The cathedral was founded in the 12th century, and according to tradition it stands on the site of where Roman governor Publius met St. Paul following his shipwreck on Malta. The original cathedral was severely damaged in the 1693 Sicily earthquake, so it was dismantled and rebuilt in the Baroque style to a design of the Maltese architect Lorenzo Gafà between 1696 and 1705. The cathedral is regarded as Gafà&apos;s masterpiece.  The cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta, and since the 19th century this function has been shared with St. John&apos;s Co-Cathedral in Valletta.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Azure Window  The Azure Windo also known as the Dwejra Window , was a 28-metre-tall natural arch on the island of Gozo. The limestone feature, which was in Dwejra Bay close to the Inland Sea and Fungus Rock, was one of the island&apos;s major tourist attractions until it collapsed in stormy weather on 8 March 2017. The arch, together with other natural features in the area, has appeared in a number of international films and media productions.  The rock formation, which consisted of a pillar rising from the sea joined to the cliff by a horizontal slab, was created by the collapse of a sea cave, probably during the 19th century. The final collapse followed a century of natural erosion, during which large sections of the limestone arch had broken off and fallen into the sea.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The name Xlendi is of Byzantine origin as it is named after a galley of the period, that was wrecked along the coast, that was called Shilandi. Evidence of this was retrieved near the entry of the bay, at the bottom of the sea, in the 1960s. Since then the site has become a popular diving site.</image:caption>

This was built so pirates or Turks could not launch attacks from this bay. This tower is still standing. It has, until recently, been abandoned with substantial damage caused to the outer walls of the tower. Responsibility for the tower was passed to the Local Council and Din l-Art Ħelwa in 2010. As of August 2020, restoration works were commenced on its outer structure. The Tower was quite important for the British Army in Malta as it was the only tower in the southwest of the island. It was entitled Tower B (secondly in place) to show its importance.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Blue Mosque in Istanbul is an Ottoman-era historical imperial mosque. A functioning mosque, it also attracts large numbers of tourist visitors. It was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its Külliye contains Ahmed&apos;s tomb, a madrasah, and a hospice. Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque’s interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque’s five main domes, six minarets, and eight secondary domes. It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, the principal mosque of Istanbul until the Blue Mosque&apos;s construction and another popular tourist site. The Blue Mosque was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1985 under the name of &quot;Historic Areas of Istanbul&quot;.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>After the Peace of Zsitvatorok and the crushing loss in the 1603–18 war with Persia, Sultan Ahmed I decided to build a large mosque in Istanbul to reassert Ottoman power. It would be the first imperial mosque for more than forty years. While his predecessors had paid for their mosques with the spoils of war, Ahmed I procured funds from the Treasury, because he had not gained remarkable victories. The construction was started in 1609 and completed in 1616.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Having been paid from the public treasury rather than from the sultan&apos;s war booty, as was done normally, it caused the anger of the ulama, the Muslim jurists. The mosque was built on the site of the palace of the Byzantine emperors, in front of the basilica Hagia Sophia (at that time, the primary imperial mosque in Istanbul) and the hippodrome, a site of significant symbolic meaning as it dominated the city skyline from the south. Big parts of the south shore of the mosque rest on the foundations, the vaults of the old Grand Palace.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Oculus / World Trade Center Station  One of the first decisions that Calatrava had in mind at the time of conceiving the project was the realization of the building at street level, an independent structure along the Wedge of Light Square, by Daniel Libeskind. “Oculus”, the centerpiece of the Transportation Center that presents the new station to the world is a kind of pause in the middle of the dense glass and steel towers that surround it.  The construction, due to constant delays, lasted 12 years and was finally inaugurated on March 3, 2016, without too many celebrations. The cost of its construction, $ 4 billion, greatly exceeded its original cost, becoming, until the time of its inauguration, the most expensive train station in the world and the third largest transportation center in New York, after Grand Central and Penn Station, both in Midtown Manhattan.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Manhattan Bridge  The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff, built by The Phoenix Bridge Company, and opened to traffic on December 31, 1909. An innovative design, it was the first suspension bridge to employ Josef Melan&apos;s deflection theory for deck stiffening, resulting in the first use of a lightly-webbed weight-saving Warren truss for its construction. Considered the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, it served as the model for many of the record-breaking spans built in the first half of the twentieth century.</image:caption>

Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on the site of two similarly-named predecessor stations, the first of which dates to 1871. Grand Central Terminal served intercity trains until 1991, when Amtrak began routing its trains through nearby Penn Station. The East Side Access project, which will bring Long Island Rail Road service to the new Grand Central Madison station beneath the terminal, is expected to be completed in late 2022.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Foucault Pendulum / Griffith Observatory  The gently swaying Foucault Pendulum in the W.M. Keck Foundation Central Rotunda has long been a visitor favorite since the building opened in 1935. One of the largest such devices in the world, the fully restored pendulum is actually an elegant scientific instrument which demonstrates the Earth’s rotation.  The 240-pound bronze ball, suspended by a cable 40 feet long, swings in a constant direction while the Earth turns beneath it. The pendulum is mounted to a bearing in the rotunda ceiling that does not turn with the building as it rotates with the Earth. A ring magnet at the bearing gives a little tug on each swing of the pendulum to keep the pendulum in motion. As the day passes, the pendulum knocks over pegs set up in the pendulum pit and indicates the progress of rotation.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Dumbo  The area known as Dumbo used to be known as Gairville. The area was originally a ferry landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, Belgian block streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art galleries, and currently a center for technology startups.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Strigino Airport is the international airport named after the Hero of the Soviet Union Valery Chkalov serving the city of Nizhny Novgorod. Strigino was officially exploited on 23 July 1923, as a domestic airport. Nizhny Novgorod International Airport is one of the oldest airports in Russia. Strigino is one of the top 25 busiest airports in Russia. Its extraordinarily rapid increase in passenger traffic rate (≤+20.0% annually) is speculated to bring it to top 10 busiest airports in Russia by 2020.</image:caption>

The Tu-144 is bigger and faster than the Concorde. Concorde&apos;s designers used fuel as coolant for the cabin air conditioning and for the hydraulic system. Tupolev also used fuel/hydraulic heat exchangers, but used cooling turbines for the cabin air.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Central Park  Between 1821 and 1855, New York City&apos;s population nearly quadrupled. As the city expanded northward up Manhattan Island, people were drawn to the few existing open spaces, mainly cemeteries, for passive recreation. These were seen as escapes from the noise and chaotic life in the city, which at the time was almost entirely centered on Lower Manhattan. The Commissioners&apos; Plan of 1811, the outline for Manhattan&apos;s modern street grid, included several smaller open spaces but not Central Park. As such, John Randel Jr. had surveyed the grounds for the construction of intersections within the modern-day park site.  Today, Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most visited tourist attractions worldwide, with 42 million visitors in 2016.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>National Air and Space Museum  Because of the museum&apos;s close proximity to the United States Capitol, the Smithsonian wanted a building that would be architecturally impressive but would not stand out too boldly against the Capitol building. St. Louis–based architect Gyo Obata of HOK designed the museum as four simple marble-encased cubes containing the smaller and more theatrical exhibits, connected by three spacious steel-and-glass atria which house the larger exhibits such as missiles, airplanes and spacecraft. The mass of the museum is similar to the National Gallery of Art across the National Mall, and uses the same pink Tennessee marble as the National Gallery. Built by Gilbane Building Company, the museum was completed in 1976. The west glass wall of the building is used for the installation of airplanes, functioning as a giant door.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Statue of Abraham Lincoln  Abraham Lincoln is a colossal seated figure of the 16th President of the United States Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) sculpted by Daniel Chester French (1850–1931) and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers. The work follows in the Beaux Arts and American Renaissance style traditions.  The figure of Lincoln gazes directly ahead and slightly down with an expression of gravity and solemnity. His frock coat is unbuttoned, and a large United States flag is draped over the chair back and sides. French paid special attention to Lincoln&apos;s expressive hands, which rest on the enormous arms of a semi-circular ceremonial chair, the fronts of which bear fasces, emblems of authority from Roman antiquity. French used casts of his own fingers to achieve the correct placement.</image:caption>

The fresco is suspended 55 meters above the rotunda floor and covers an area of 433.3 square meters. The figures painted are up to 4.6 meters tall and are visible from the floor below. The dome was completed in 1863, and Brumidi painted it over the course of 11 months at the end of the Civil War. He was paid $40,000 ($676,261 in today&apos;s funds) for the fresco.  Brumidi had worked for three years in the Vatican under Pope Gregory XVI, and served several aristocrats as an artist for palaces and villas, including the prince Torlonia. He immigrated to the United States in 1852, and spent much of the last 25 years of his life working in the Capitol.

      <image:caption>Boeing VC-137B &quot;Air Force One&quot;  The first presidential jet plane, a specially built Boeing 707-153, is known as SAM (Special Air Mission) 970. This aircraft, as well as any other Air Force aircraft, carried the call sign &quot;Air Force One&quot; when the president was aboard. Delivered in 1959 to replace President Eisenhower&apos;s Super-Constellation, the high-speed jet transport was a flying Oval Office with a modified interior and sophisticated communication equipment. Eisenhower became the first U.S. president to fly by jet on SAM 970 on August 26, 1959.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Boeing VC-137B &quot;Air Force One&quot;  SAM 970 was the first of three 707s acquired in 1959 as presidential aircraft, designated the VC-137 series. In addition to Eisenhower, SAM 970 has carried Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as foreign leaders such as Nikita Khrushchev. In 1962, SAM 970 was replaced on primary presidential duty by a newer Boeing VC-137C. It was later used by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for North Vietnamese peace talks in 1970-71, secret talks with the Chinese in 1971, and Middle East &quot;shuttle diplomacy&quot; in 1974. SAM 970 remained in the presidential fleet ferrying VIPs and the Vice-President until June of 1996.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Königsberg Cathedral is a Brick Gothic-style monument located on Kneiphof island in the Pregel (Pregolya) river. It is the most significant preserved building of the former City of Königsberg, which was largely destroyed in World War II.  Dedicated to Virgin Mary and St Adalbert, it was built as the see of the Prince-Bishops of Samland in the 14th century. Upon the establishment of the secular Duchy of Prussia, it became the Lutheran Albertina University church in 1544. The spire and roof of the cathedral burnt down after two RAF bombing raids in late August 1944; reconstruction started in 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Königsberg Cathedral  A first smaller Catholic cathedral was erected in the Königsberg Altstadt between 1297 and 1302. After the Samland bishop Johann Clare had acquired the eastern part of Kneiphof island from the Teutonic Knights in 1322, he and his cathedral chapter had a new see built at the site and ensured its autonomy by a 1333 treaty with Grand Master Luther von Braunschweig.  The construction is considered to have begun about 1330. The original building in Altstadt was subsequently demolished and materials from it were used to build the new cathedral on Kneiphof. The soil on which the cathedral was built was marshy, and so hundreds of oak poles were put into the ground before the construction of the cathedral could begin. After a relatively short period of almost 50 years, the cathedral was largely completed by 1380, while works on the interior frescoes lasted until the end of the 14th century.</image:caption>

It is located in the city center, on the shore of Lake Verkhneye. Construction on the museum began in 1972. The museum opened in 1979 and houses about 14,000 individual pieces. The museum occupies part of a reconstructed fortification, originally built by Karl Friedrich Emil zu Dohna-Schlobitten in the Napoleonic wars. Among the exhibits are the world&apos;s second-largest piece of amber and a 4-foot-tall vase named The Abundance, as well as a collection of over 3,000 amber inclusions. One of the most famous organic inclusions is a small lizard.</image:caption>

Kaliningrad, until 1946 known as Königsberg is situated on the Pregolya River, at the head of the Vistula Lagoon on the Baltic Sea, and is the only ice-free port of Russia and the Baltic states on the Baltic Sea.  Königsberg was the easternmost large city in Germany until World War II. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in 1944 and during the Battle of Königsberg in 1945, when it was occupied by the Soviet Union. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 placed it provisionally under Soviet administration, and it was annexed on 9 April 1945. Its German population was expelled, and the city was repopulated with Russians and others from the Soviet Union. It was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946 in honor of Soviet leader Mikhail Kalinin.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Vistula Spit  Until the 13th century, the spit had navigable straits in the middle, which allowed the city of Elbing, part of the monastic State of the Teutonic Knights, direct access to the Baltic Sea. The natural closing of the straits in the late 13th century reduced Elbing&apos;s status as an important trading seaport. This and the Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Polish Pomerania in 1308 led to the increased importance of Gdańsk.  During World War II, it became the last holdout of the remaining German soldiers in East Prussia, although the Soviets simply bypassed the spit after the East Prussian Offensive was decisively concluded, training their sights on the more important goal of capturing Berlin. The last Wehrmacht soldiers laid down their arms after the German Instrument of Surrender was signed.</image:caption>

Population figures: 13,026 (2010 Census).  In its heyday, Zelenogradsk (as Cranz) was a popular seaside resort on Germany&apos;s eastern Baltic coast, comparable to Bognor Regis in England. However, at the end of World War II, the Soviets took over the town, and much of its tourist traffic has been diverted to nearby Svetlogorsk, formerly called Rauschen.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Curonian Spit  The Curonian Spit was formed about the 3rd millennium BC. A glacial moraine served as its foundation; winds and sea currents later contributed enough sand to raise and keep the formation above sea level.  The existence of this narrow shoal is inherently threatened by the natural processes that govern shoreline features. It depends on a dynamic balance between sand transport and deposition. If (hypothetically) the source area to the southwest were cut off, say, by a large port construction with a pier, the spit would erode and eventually disappear. It is thus a geologically speaking ephemeral coast element. The most likely development, however, is that the shallow bay inside the Curonian Spit will eventually fill up with sediment, thus creating new land.</image:caption>

Unlike drunken forests, the trees in the Dancing Forest are twisted into several patterns, such as rings, hearts, and convoluted spirals bending to the ground. The exact cause of the trees&apos; distortion is unknown. According to one version, the distortion is caused by the activity of the caterpillar of Rhyacionia buoliana. In the folk version, the Dancing Forest follows the movement of the sands.</image:caption>

Several ecological communities are present on and near the Spit, from its outer beaches to dune ridges, wetlands, meadows, and forests. Its location on the East Atlantic Flyway means it is frequently visited by migratory waterfowl. Between 10 and 20 million birds fly over the feature during spring and fall migrations, and many pause to rest or breed there.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Königsberg Cathedral  Königsberg was the capital of East Prussia from the Late Middle Ages until 1945, and the easternmost large German city until it was conquered by the Soviet Union near the end of World War II.  In late August 1944, British bombers carried out two-night raids on Königsberg. The first raid, on 26/27 August, largely missed the city, but the second raid, on 29/30, destroyed most of the old part of Königsberg (including Kneiphof), and the cathedral was hit. The part of the cathedral directly underneath the spire (today&apos;s Lutheran chapel) is where 20 to 25 citizens of Koenigsberg survived during the second air raid. During reconstruction in 1992, hundreds of skeletons, mostly of children, were discovered under tons of rubble in that area. The predominance of children and the circumstances of their internment cast doubt on whether the remains were in fact victims of the air raid.</image:caption>

She participated in creating the national nuclear-missile shield and was used in the testing and flight of spacecraft. After the Soviet Union was broken up and a difficult economic situation in the 1990s, the fleet was dissolved.  The vessel was named after Viktor Patsayev, an astronaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, and our fellow townsman. On November 24, 1978, a pennant of the USSR Academy of Sciences was hoisted. Till 1994 the vessel was a part of a terminal complex used to control satellites and interplanetary stations, to receive and process information, and to communicate with astronauts. She was a range ship equipped with antennas and electronics and sailed the World Ocean. Even today the ship performs the same tasks as 30 years ago: she provides communication with the International Space Station.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Königsberg Cathedral  After the war, the cathedral remained a burnt-out shell and Kneiphof was made into a park with no other buildings. Before the war, Kneiphof had many buildings. One of the buildings was the first Albertina University building, where Immanuel Kant taught, which was situated next to the east side of the cathedral. New construction nearby includes the House of the Soviets.  Shortly after Kaliningrad was opened to foreigners in the early 1990s, work began to reconstruct the cathedral. In 1994 a new spire was put in place using a helicopter. In 1995 a new clock was put in place. The clock has four bells (1,180 kg, 700 kg, 500 kg &amp; 200 kg), all cast in 1995. The clock chimes every quarter of an hour. On the hour, the clock chimes by playing the first notes of Beethoven&apos;s Symphony No. 5, followed by monotonic chiming to indicate the hour.</image:caption>

Prior to the Games, the arena hosted the IIHF World U18 Championships and Channel One Cup in 2013.  The arena&apos;s exterior is distinguished by its LED-illuminated roof, which its designers described as resembling fabergé eggs and frozen water droplets.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Siberian dwarf pine on the slopes of the Barguzinsky Range.  Pinus pumila, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf pine, dwarf Siberian pine is a tree in the family Pinaceae native to northeastern Asia and the Japanese isles. It shares the common name creeping pine with several other plants.  The Siberian dwarf pine is a coniferous evergreen shrub ranging from 1–3 m in height, exceptionally up to 5 m, but may have individual branches that extend farther along the ground in length. In the mountains of northern Japan, it sometimes hybridises with the related Japanese white pine (Pinus parviflora); these hybrids (Pinus × hakkodensis) are larger than P. pumila, reaching 8–10 m tall on occasion.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>During the hike, no matter where I was - on the top of high mountains, in the middle of impenetrable forests, or on the popular beach, I met tourists from all over the world. I was greatly impressed by their fearlessness and love of adventure. Some of the tourists were traveling alone — I met a French gentleman and a young lady from Moscow. I was alarmed that both lacked any understanding of the principles of surviving in the wild and their complete defenselessness against possible dangers.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The day before arriving in the bay, the bear tore the fishermen&apos;s tent to shreds. Fortunately, the fishermen were on the voyage at that moment. Forewarned of what happened, we set up a night guard and a sound alarm.  To our great surprise, on the evening, almost immediately after sunset, a young one and a half-year-old bear easily bypassed the alarm, going exactly along the perimeter of the installation. This is how my first close encounter with a wild bear took place. He walked at a distance of five meters from me and with an imperturbable gaze went further into the forest.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Svyatoy Nos or Holy Nose is a large peninsula on the eastern edge of Lake Baikal, Eastern Siberia, in the Barguzinsky District of the Republic of Buryatia. It is part of the Zabaykalsky (Trans-Baikal) National Park.  The name &quot;Svyatoy Nos&quot; means &quot;Holy Nose&quot; in Russian. Russian explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries used the word &quot;nose&quot; to mean &quot;cape&quot;. &quot;Holy Nose&quot; originally referred to the southwestern cape of the peninsula, and a (now abandoned) village on that cape. Then the name passed on the whole territory of the peninsula. In the Buryat language, the peninsula is called Hilmen Hushun, which means &quot;sturgeon&apos;s muzzle.&quot;</image:caption>

Approximately twenty thousand animals live in a territory of about sixty thousand square kilometers. The greatest densities occur on the western slope of the Bargyzinski Range between the Malaya Cheremshava and Shirildi Rivers. All the areas have a low human population, extensive mountain taiga, an abundance of food, and a prohibition on hunting for bears.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Sukhoi Su-24 is a supersonic, all-weather attack aircraft. The aircraft has a variable-sweep wing, twin-engines, and a side-by-side seating arrangement for its crew of two. It was the first of the USSR&apos;s aircraft to carry an integrated digital navigation/attack system.  The Mikoyan MiG-31 is a supersonic interceptor aircraft that was developed for use by the Soviet Air Forces. The aircraft was designed by the Mikoyan design bureau as a replacement for the earlier MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot;. The MiG-31 is among the fastest combat jets in the world.  The Sukhoi Su-17 is a variable-sweep wing fighter-bomber developed for the Soviet military. Developed from the Sukhoi Su-7, the Su-17 was the first variable-sweep wing aircraft to enter Soviet service. Two subsequent Sukhoi aircraft, the Su-20, and Su-22 have usually been regarded as variants of the Su-17.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The Yakovlev Yak-9 was a single-engine single-seat multi-purpose fighter aircraft used by the Soviet Union in World War II and after. The Yak-9 started arriving in Soviet fighter aviation regiments in late 1942 and played a major role in retaking air superiority from the Luftwaffe&apos;s new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109G fighters during the grand Battle of Kursk in summer 1943.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The T-54 and T-55 tanks are a series of Soviet main battle tanks introduced in the years following the Second World War. The first T-54 prototype was completed at Nizhny Tagil by the end of 1945. From the late 1950s, the T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army, armies of the Warsaw Pact countries, and many others. T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world&apos;s armed conflicts since their introduction in the last half of the 20th century.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The T-18 light tank was the first Soviet-designed tank. Produced from 1928 to 1931, it was based on the Renault FT, with the addition of a vertically sprung suspension. The T-18 and its derivatives were essentially unsuccessful designs, but they gave Soviet industry its first experiences in designing armored vehicles.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The IS-3 is a Soviet heavy tank developed in late 1944. Its semi-hemispherical cast turret became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks.  The IS-2 is the first of the IS tank series named after the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. It was developed and saw combat during World War II, and saw service in other Soviet allied countries after the war.  The KV-2 is a heavy assault tank with the M-10 152 mm howitzer. Few were produced due to its combat ineffectiveness, mainly the decreased speed due to the weight of the new gun and turret.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>The S-75 is a Soviet-designed, high-altitude air defence system, built around a surface-to-air missile with command guidance. Following its first deployment in 1957, it became one of the most widely deployed air defence systems in history. It scored the first destruction of an enemy aircraft by a surface-to-air missile, with the shooting down of a Taiwanese Martin RB-57D Canberra over China on 7 October 1959 that was hit by a salvo of three V-750 (1D) missiles at an altitude of 20 km (65,600 ft). This success was credited to Chinese fighter aircraft at the time to keep the S-75 program secret.  The 2K11 Krug is a Soviet and now Russian medium-range, medium-to-high altitude surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. The system was designed by NPO Novator and produced by Kalinin Machine Building Plant. Its GRAU designation is &quot;2K11.&quot;  The Buk missile is a family of self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile systems designed to counter cruise missiles, smart bombs, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Buk missile system is the successor to the NIIP/Vympel 2K12 Kub. The first version of Buk adopted into service carried the GRAU designation 9K37 Buk and was identified in the west with the NATO reporting name &quot;Gadfly&quot; as well as the US Department of Defense designation SA-11.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi fortress (also known as Akkerman fortress) is a historical and architectural monument of the 13th-14th centuries. The fortress was built on the remains of Tyras, an ancient Greek city on the northern coast of the Black Sea which existed until the 4th century. Antes, Slavs, and Bulgarians lived at the site of Tyras after the Greeks. It is not known when Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi fortress was founded. Most historians believe that it was a trading enclave of the Republic of Genoa first established in the 13th century. The territory was surrendered to the Golden Horde at that time, but the Genoese managed to ally with the Mongols. Bilhorod was officially the Tatars’ city, but it was ruled by the Genoese. The fortress controlled the Dniester estuary.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>After the territory came under the control of the Principality of Moldavia, the Moldavians started to call Bilhorod Cetatea Alba (literally the White Citadel). In the 15th century, the city was a real metropolis. There were about 20000 inhabitants - Moldavians, Greeks, Genoese, Armenians, Jews, Tatars. It was the start of the greatest development period in the city&apos;s history. The city was based on a fortress, which had already grown significantly. Its main elements had been constructed by 1440; the fortress had 34 towers, some as tall as 20 meters. Outside the fortress was surrounded by a deep moat. The fortress was built of white limestone, for which a mortar made of eggs, crushed marble, carbon, and silicon was used.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>In the 15th century, The Ottoman Empire repeatedly tried to capture the city. The hardest siege was in August 1484, when a 300,000-man army of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II and 50,000 troops of the Crimean Khan Meñli I Giray supported by over 100 large ships besieged the castle on the coast and estuary. After a 9-day siege, the fortress was taken. In 1485, the owner Stephen the Great tried to recapture Bilhorod, but he failed. Turkish people would rule there for 328 years. In 1918, Romania briefly reestablished control over Budjak after the unification of Romania and Bessarabia in 1918, but the Soviets reclaimed the city and the surrounding territory in 1940 and again in 1944.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra is a historic Eastern Orthodox Christian monastery that gave its name to one of the city districts where it is located in Kyiv. Since its foundation as the cave monastery in 1051, the Lavra has been a preeminent center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Eastern Europe. According to the Primary Chronicle, in the early 11th century, Anthony, a Christian monk from Esphigmenon monastery on Mount Athos, originally from Liubech of the Principality of Chernigov, returned to Rus&apos; and settled in Kyiv as a missionary of monastic tradition to Kyivan Rus&apos;. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the Dnieper River and a community of disciples soon grew. Prince Iziaslav I of Kyiv ceded the whole mount to the Anthonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from Constantinople.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Memorial to the victims of the Holodomor. The Holodomor also known as the Terror-Famine and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. As part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Monument to Mikhail Panikovsky - a monument dedicated to the legendary character of the satirical novel The Little Golden Calf by Soviet authors Ilya Ilf and Evgeny Petrov, published in 1931. The hero of the novel is depicted in the guise of a blind man. At the same time, the monument also contains many small but symbolic details. For example, under Panikovsky&apos;s left foot, you can see a coin, on which he hurries to step, besides, the most curious can substitute a mirror under his foot and see the reflection of the well-known figure of three fingers.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>House with Chimaeras is an Art Nouveau building located in the historic Lypky neighborhood of Kyiv. The building has been used as a presidential residence for official and diplomatic ceremonies since 2005. The Polish architect Władysław Horodecki originally constructed the House with Chimaeras for use as his own upmarket apartment building during the period of 1901–1902. However, as the years went by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki&apos;s original plans.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>St Andrew&apos;s Church is an Orthodox church in Kyiv, constructed between 1747 and 1754 to a design by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli, a rare example of Elizabethan Baroque in Ukraine. Situated on a steep hill, where Andrew the Apostle is believed to have foretold the great future of the place as the cradle of Christianity in the Slavic lands, the church overlooks the historic Podil neighborhood. Since 1968, the building has been a museum, part of the National Sanctuary &quot;Sophia of Kyiv&quot; as a landmark of cultural heritage. At the beginning of the 21st century, the building faced serious problems due to the unstable foundation and it underwent a major renovation at the end of the 2010s, after it was gifted to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.</image:caption>

      <image:caption>Maidan Nezalezhnosti is the central square of Kyiv. One of the city&apos;s main squares. It has been known under many different names, but often it is called simply Maidan (&quot;square&quot;). In the 19th century, the square contained buildings of the city council and noble assembly. Since the start of Ukraine&apos;s independence movement in 1990, the square has been the traditional place for political rallies, including four large-scale radical protest campaigns: the 1990 student &quot;Revolution on Granite&quot;, the 2001 &quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot;, the 2004 Orange Revolution, and the 2013–14 Euromaidan. Maidan is also a regular site for non-political displays and events, however, since 2014 most of them were moved to Sofiyivska Square or elsewhere, because making entertainment in a place where people were killed during Euromaidan was considered inappropriate. Most notably, Christmas Fairs and New Year celebrations were moved to Sofiyivska Square.</image:caption>
