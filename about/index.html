              <p>
                As a founding member of a newly established R&D team at Derivco, I contributed to the design and development of a next-generation social networking platform focused on video content. The project was fully exploratory, requiring architecture and solutions to be built from the ground up. My responsibilities included <strong>leading solution architecture, rapid prototyping, and ensuring the scalability and robustness</strong> of the platform to support high-volume user engagement.
              </p>

              <p>
                In my role as a full-stack engineer, I worked across both front-end and back-end domains. On the front-end, I implemented social media interfaces, built responsive components, and optimized <strong>UI performance for speed and cross-device responsiveness</strong>. I also improved the overall user experience by refining interaction flows, enhancing visual consistency, and <strong>prototyping key components</strong> to validate new ideas and features.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the back-end, I was responsible for architecting and implementing <strong>high-performance services for media handling</strong>, covering ingestion, processing, storage, and retrieval of video content. This work required careful attention to performance, scalability, and cost efficiency, and laid the technical foundation for a product that seamlessly integrated social engagement with large-scale video delivery.
