Construction began on the Paris Las Vegas Resort & Casino and its accompanying tower in 1997, with its completion taking place the following year. The Paris connects to its sister hotel, Bally’s, via tram. Initially, plans included a full-size replica of the famous Eiffel Tower, but due to flight path concerns from McCarran Airport, the tower had to be scaled down. Despite the reduction in its size, the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas still offers the highest viewpoint of the Las Vegas Strip. At its architectural height, it stands over 12 meters taller than the High Roller Ferris wheel at the nearby LINQ.
