The construction, due to constant delays, lasted 12 years and was finally inaugurated on March 3, 2016, without too many celebrations. The cost of its construction, $ 4 billion, greatly exceeded its original cost, becoming, until the time of its inauguration, the most expensive train station in the world and the third largest transportation center in New York, after Grand Central and Penn Station, both in Midtown Manhattan.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_002_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption">New York Harbor</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image vertical" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_003_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption vertical">Manhattan Bridge The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff, built by The Phoenix Bridge Company, and opened to traffic on December 31, 1909. An innovative design, it was the first suspension bridge to employ Josef Melan's deflection theory for deck stiffening, resulting in the first use of a lightly-webbed weight-saving Warren truss for its construction. Considered the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, it served as the model for many of the record-breaking spans built in the first half of the twentieth century.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image vertical" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_004_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption vertical">Cycling in New York City Approximately eight hundred thousand New Yorkers ride a bike regularly.

Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on the site of two similarly-named predecessor stations, the first of which dates to 1871. Grand Central Terminal served intercity trains until 1991, when Amtrak began routing its trains through nearby Penn Station. The East Side Access project, which will bring Long Island Rail Road service to the new Grand Central Madison station beneath the terminal, is expected to be completed in late 2022.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_013_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption">On the Streets of New York</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image vertical" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_014_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption vertical">Arlington National Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose 259 ha the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars.

Keck Foundation Central Rotunda has long been a visitor favorite since the building opened in 1935. One of the largest such devices in the world, the fully restored pendulum is actually an elegant scientific instrument which demonstrates the Earth’s rotation. The 240-pound bronze ball, suspended by a cable 40 feet long, swings in a constant direction while the Earth turns beneath it. The pendulum is mounted to a bearing in the rotunda ceiling that does not turn with the building as it rotates with the Earth. A ring magnet at the bearing gives a little tug on each swing of the pendulum to keep the pendulum in motion. As the day passes, the pendulum knocks over pegs set up in the pendulum pit and indicates the progress of rotation.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Andrey Pudov Conquering America 2.0" class="img-responsive gallery-image vertical" src="/photographs/2017-09-09_24/2017-09-09_24_022_large.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption vertical">Golden Gate Bridge The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.
